Exercise Fitness iOS App

App Description:
Xercise Fitness - A unique fitness app that doesn't put you through the agonizing process of searching for your own exercises, but quickly gives them to you! Simply choose a muscle group you'd like to workout, and get a randomly selected exercise or even an entire workout created by fitness experts! See an exercise or workout you like? Save it for later, share it with friends or even share it to Facebook and Twitter! 

Have a great exercise? With Xercise Fitness youâ€™re able to create your own exercises and workouts and have the option to share them with all other app users or just keep them on your device for personal reference. Once a workout has been created, your friends or teammates can download any workout with a group code you share with them! 

Additionally, Xercise Fitness allows you to set a macronutrient goal and keep track of the macros in your meals to help maintain your diet!
